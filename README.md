# Project Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for React/Redux/Express full stack applications.

I created this so that there would be an easy way to handle all of the nasty parts of the project like transpiling code and deploying to servers, so that you can make your idea faster and easier. <3

Features:  
1. Hot module reloading  
2. Sass  
3. Linting  
4. Travis YML for automatic production deployment on AWS  

This project uses create react app.  
The server and client are run separately.  

#### How to use
```bash
# terminal 1
cd client
npm i
npm start

# terminal 2
cd server
npm i
npm start
```

#### How to deploy
